## Collection Description
My collection focuses on Wills’ Cigarette cards, particularly cards that show architecture
and notable figures, along with scans of both the front artwork and the descriptive backs.
This theme is interesting because cigarette cards were an early form of media and
advertising, and they reflect how companies used art, locational imagery, and culture to
educate consumers. They also preserve historical views of buildings, cities, and people
that may have changed or disappeared. This makes them valuable as both advertising
history and documentation of how people viewed the era.

This collection may be useful to historians, architecture lovers, collectors, and students
studying these fields. An audience could use the collection to compare architectural
styles, study the design and language of early advertising, or even explore how popular
imagery circulated internationally in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
contents of the collection consist primarily of digitized images of cigarette cards gathered
from **NYPL** and other digital museums, which provide public-domain scans and metadata
about each item.
